# Spooky Surprise

An immersive, interactive Halloween adventure game featuring branching narratives, atmospheric audio, and sophisticated visual effects.

## Overview

Spooky Surprise is a text-based interactive fiction experience where players assume the role of a Brichan (guardian/hunter) navigating through a dark fantasy narrative. The game features three distinct story paths (Faith, Reflection, and Corruption), each with unique scenarios, moral dilemmas, dice-based skill checks, and multiple endings determined by player choices.

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or pnpm package manager
- Modern web browser with Web Audio API support

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

### Building for Production

Create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized build will be output to the `dist/` directory.

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Linting

Run ESLint to check code quality:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Architecture

### State Management

The application uses Zustand for global state management with the following structure:

- `currentNode` - Current story node identifier
- `visited` - Array of visited node identifiers
- `lastRoll` - Most recent dice roll result
- `soundEnabled` - Audio toggle state
- `playerName` - Player's chosen character name
- `volume` - Audio volume level (0-1)
- `currentPath` - Active story path (faith/reflection/corruption)
- `gameStarted` - Game initialization state

State is persisted to localStorage for settings preservation across sessions.

### Story Data Structure

Story nodes follow this structure:

```typescript
interface StoryNode {
  id: string                      // Node identifier and display title
  text: string | ((playerName: string) => string)
  choices?: StoryChoice[]         // Available player actions
  diceCheck?: {                   // Optional skill check
    stat: string                  // Skill being tested
    target: number                // Difficulty class
    success: string               // Node ID on success
    fail: string                  // Node ID on failure
  }
  requiresName?: boolean          // Show name input before choices
  imagePath: string | null        // Background image path
  audioPath?: string              // Scene-specific audio
}
```

### Audio System Architecture

The audio system uses a shared Web Audio API context with:

- **Dual-buffer crossfading** for seamless background music loops
- **Path-specific track switching** based on story progression
- **Separate audio graphs** for background music, scene audio, and sound effects
- **Autoplay policy handling** with user gesture detection

## Browser Compatibility

The application requires a modern browser with support for:
- ES2020+
- Web Audio API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- localStorage
- Optional: Fullscreen API (for BSOD Easter egg)

Tested and verified on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance Considerations

- **Cursor animations** use `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps performance
- **Trail particles** are created sparingly and auto-removed after 1 second
- **Audio buffers** are reused to minimize memory allocation
- **Canvas rendering** for maze game uses efficient pixel-based collision detection
- **Component memoization** prevents unnecessary re-renders
